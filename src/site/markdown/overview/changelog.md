# PMD Release Notes

## ????? - 5.4.4-SNAPSHOT

The PMD team is pleased to announce PMD 5.4.4

This is a bug fixing release. The most significant changes are on analysis performance.

Multithread performance has been enhanced by reducing thread-contention on a
bunch of areas. This is still an area of work, as the speedup of running
multithreaded analysis is still relatively small (4 threads produce less
than a 50% speedup). Future releases will keep improving on this area.

Once again, *Symbol Table* has been an area of great performance improvements.
This time we were able to further improve it's performance by roughly 10% on all
supported languages. In *Java* in particular, several more improvements were possible,
improving *Symbol Table* performance by a whooping 30%, that's over 5X faster
than PMD 5.4.2, when we first started working on it.

Java developers will also appreciate the revamp of `CloneMethodMustImplementCloneable`,
making it over 500X faster, and `PreserveStackTrace` which is now 7X faster.
