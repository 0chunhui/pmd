### New and noteworthy

#### New Rules

##### AccessorMethodGeneration (java-design)

When accessing a private field / method from another class, the Java compiler will generate a accessor methods
with package-private visibility. This adds overhead, and to the dex method count on Android. This situation can
be avoided by changing the visibility of the field / method from private to package-private.

For instance, it would report violations on code such as:

```
public class OuterClass {
    private int counter;
    /* package */ int id;

    public class InnerClass {
        InnerClass() {
            OuterClass.this.counter++; // wrong, accessor method will be generated
        }

        public int getOuterClassId() {
            return OuterClass.this.id; // id is package-private, no accessor method needed
        }
    }
}
```

This new rule is part of the `java-design` ruleset.
