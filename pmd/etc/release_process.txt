PMD release walkthrough:

Make sure code is up to date and everything is in svn:

$ mvn clean
$ svn update
$ svn status

Ensure all the new rules are listed in a rulesets/releases/<version>.xml file.

Update the "download" and "what's new" link in navigation.xml.

Update version/release info in etc/changelog.txt.

$ mvn verify post-site    (order of targets DOES matter)

Unzip and test manually (just to be on the safe side of the road):

./bin/pmd.sh ~/tmp/Test.java xml java-unusedcode
./bin/pmd.sh ~/tmp/Test.java html rulesets/unusedcode.xml

Check in all (version) changes to trunk:
$ svn ci -m "pmd: Prepare pmd release <version>"


Let the maven create a release branch (note - this is of course not needed if you are already on a release/maintenance
branch). Maven will automatically increase the version in trunk.

$ mvn release:branch -DbranchName=<version>.x

Now checkout the created branch.

$ svn co https://pmd.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/pmd/branches/pmd/<version>.x
$ cd <version>.x

Now let maven create a release tag.

$ mvn release:clean release:prepare

The next command will checkout PMD from the tag just created and will build and deploy it
to sonatype OSS repositories:

$ mvn release:perform


Note:
If you see a bug and fix it, you can rollback the release
(see http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-release-plugin/examples/rollback-release.html):
$ mvn release:rollback
You probably need to delete the release tag manually using the following command (and then
start again with release:clean release:prepare):
$ svn delete https://pmd.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/pmd/tags/pmd/pmd-<version>


Finally, in order to publish the release to Maven central, you need to release PMD via Sonatype Nexus:
- Login to https://oss.sonatype.org/
- Go to Staging Repositories page
- Select a staging repository
- Click the close button
- Now you can download the artifacts again and verify they are working.
- Once you are sure they are working, click "Release" and the artifacts are eventually available through maven central.



Public the release on sourceforge:
- Go to Admin, File Releases, Add release
- Paste stuff into the changelog/readme boxes
- Add the pmd-<version>-bin.zip file
- Add the pmd-<version>-src.zip file

Upload command below will create and upload the maven artifacts to sourceforge. Login info
for 'pmd-repo' and 'pmd-site' must be defined in ~/.m2/settings.xml
(see the file available in ../../maven-plugin-pmd-build/config/m2.settings.xml):

$ ssh your_sf_login,pmd@shell.sourceforge.net create
...
$ mvn deploy -Psf-release

(In order to be able to upload the artifacts and the site to sourceforge, you need to have a interactive shell opened
before)

Upload the site:

$ mvn site-deploy -Psf-release

Shutdown the sourceforge shell:

$ ssh your_sf_login@shell.sourceforge.net "shutdown"

Social side of release:
1) Submit news to SF
    Go to http://freshmeat.net/

2) Facebook, Google+, Twitter, LinkedIn and Xing (add whatever you feel is missing here...)
