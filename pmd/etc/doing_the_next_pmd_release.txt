PMD release walkthrough:

Make sure code is up to date and everything is in svn:

$ mvn clean
$ svn update
$ svn status

Ensure all the new rules are listed in a rulesets/releases/<version>.xml file

$ mvn package post-site    (order of targets DOES matter)

Unzip and test manually (just to be on the safe side of the road):

./bin/pmd.sh ~/tmp/Test.java xml unusedcode
./bin/pmd.sh ~/tmp/Test.java html rulesets/unusedcode.xml

Check all changes and tag:

$ svn tag https://pmd.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/pmd/tags/pmd/pmd_release_<version>

Note:
If you see a bug and fix it, you can delete the release using the following command (and then
recreate the tag):
$ svn delete https://pmd.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/pmd/tags/pmd/pmd_release_<version>

Public the release on sourceforge:
- Go to Admin, File Releases, Add release
- Paste stuff into the changelog/readme boxes
- Add the pmd-bin-<version>.zip file
- Add the pmd-src-<version>.zip file

Upload command below will create and upload the maven artifacts to sourceforge. Login info
for 'pmd-repo' must be defined in ~/.m2/settings.xml (see the file available in
tools/config/m2.settings.xml):

$ ssh your_sf_login,pmd@shell.sourceforge.net create
...
$ mvn source:jar javadoc:jar deploy -Psf-release    (order of target DOES matter)

(In order to be able to upload the artifacts and the site to sourceforge, you need to have a interactive shell opened
before)

Update the "download" and "what's new" link in navigation.xml.

$ mvn site site:deploy -Psf-release

Shutdown the sourceforge shell:

$ ssh your_sf_login@shell.sourceforge.net "shutdown"

Social side of release:
1) Submit news to SF
    Go to http://freshmeat.net/

2) Facebook, Google+, Twitter, LinkedIn and Xing (add whatever you feel is missing here...)
