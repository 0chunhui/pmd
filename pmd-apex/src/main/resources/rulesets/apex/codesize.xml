		<description>
The NPath complexity of a method is the number of acyclic execution paths through that method.
A threshold of 200 is generally considered the point where measures should be taken to reduce 
complexity and increase readability.

		externalInfoUrl="${pmd.website.baseurl}/rules/apex/codesize.html#ExcessiveMethodLength">
		<description>
When methods are excessively long this usually indicates that the method is doing more than its
name/signature might suggest. They also become challenging for others to digest since excessive 
scrolling causes readers to lose focus.
Try to reduce the method length by creating helper methods and removing any copy/pasted code.

Methods with numerous parameters are a challenge to maintain, especially if most of them share the
same datatype. These situations usually denote the need for new objects to wrap the numerous parameters.

Excessive class file lengths are usually indications that the class may be burdened with excessive 
responsibilities that could be provided by external classes or functions. In breaking these methods
apart the code becomes more managable and ripe for reuse.

		<description>
      <![CDATA[
Complexity directly affects maintenance costs is determined by the number of decision points in a method 
plus one for the method entry.  The decision points include 'if', 'while', 'for', and 'case labels' calls.  
Generally, numbers ranging from 1-4 denote low complexity, 5-7 denote moderate complexity, 8-10 denote
high complexity, and 11+ is very high complexity.

Classes that have too many fields can become unwieldy and could be redesigned to have fewer fields,
possibly through grouping related fields in new objects.  For example, a class with individual 
city/state/zip fields could park them within a single Address field.
